# google-homepage
An Odin Project. 


a brief introduction for what the current project is and what skills you have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project which is a good way to review what you have learned.)

This is a replica of the Google homepage make as a challenge from The Odin Project. I challenged myself to not look at the source code of the real Google homepage, and I did pretty well. I used the source code for comparing the margin and padding, and the font and font size used.

I believe the code is fairly easy implemented with almost the same result. The difficulties lay in the footer and placing the elements in the table where I wanted them. I wwould like to learn JS to be able to make the content more flexible when resizing the window. As for now, the footer is overlapping the content when the window is reduced....
